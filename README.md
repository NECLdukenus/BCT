Objective measurement of Mindfulness

This task is run on Matlab with Psychtoolbox. Due to multiple versions of MATLAB and Psychtoolbox being available and varying degree of support on different OS, please test before using.

Eprime 2 experiment file is available. Please change the experiment setting. Currently will not save participant number but only add the timestamp of running the script into the output file name.
